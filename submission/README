Funktion im Kopf der Mensch

Each submission must be a single .tar.gz compressed archive file 
containing (at least) two executable files "./install" and "./run", 
and a "./src/" directory.

Additionally, the archive may include an optional "./README" file, 
explaining the most interesting aspect(s) of the submission. This 
file will be used for determining the discretionary judges' prize.
